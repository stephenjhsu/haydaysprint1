# haydaysprint1

In the sprint 1 project, the goal is to write a Python script which can deploy our code to an AWS server. 

The current Github repo contains the script that we will call from deploy.py to 

  1. Clone the Github into an AWS instance
  2. Create a cron task to run myscript.py every 5 minutes
  3. Logout
